# Naive-Bayes
- Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
- Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions. 
- It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
- It handles both continuous and discrete data.
- It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
- Some popular examples of Naïve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.

## Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' theorem is also known as **Bayes' Rule** or **Bayes' law**, which is used to determine the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on the conditional probability.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is given as:

Where,

**P(A|B) is Posterior probability:** Probability of hypothesis A on the observed event B.

**P(B|A) is Likelihood probability:** Probability of the evidence given that the probability of a hypothesis is true.

**P(A) is Prior Probability:** Probability of hypothesis before observing the evidence.

**P(B) is Marginal Probability:** Probability of Evidence .
