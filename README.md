# Naive-Bayes
- Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
- Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions. 
- It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
- It handles both continuous and discrete data.
